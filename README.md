# museumOfCandy
Hi everyone! This is my project of the main page of a fictional "Museum of candy" written with HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
Here you can see navbar which gets a colored field when you scroll. 
Also, this navbar gets a collapsed view and a button to expand it on smaller screens.
You can see beautiful pictures of candies and short facts about sweets with hover effect.
You can even hover on a white candy icon above the paragraph.
Here you can see a deployed version of this [project](https://yevgenpanchenko.github.io/museumOfCandy/).
